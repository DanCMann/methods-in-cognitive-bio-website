This is a supporting website for the statistics and programming module of the Methods in Cognitive Biology offered at the University of Vienna. This course is taught by Cliodhna Quigley, Lisa Horn-PÃ©ter, & Dan C. Mann.

I (Dan C. Mann) built this website to have an easy place to host the documents that I write for class instruction. I'm not experienced in website design or construction so don't judge too harshly :) (I'm happy to hear feedback, though!) I built the site using R Markdown and GitHub Pages.
